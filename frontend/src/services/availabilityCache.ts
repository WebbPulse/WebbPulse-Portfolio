/**
 * The one-probe-per-page-load cache both capability probes share.
 *
 * ## Why there is a cache at all
 *
 * webbpulse-python publishes no discovery document. Whether a deployment has
 * OAuth configured, and whether it has passwordless passkey sign-in switched
 * on, are both observable only by asking the route and reading the answer. A
 * probe is therefore a real request against a real rate limit bucket: the
 * standard's section 5.1 allows twenty OAuth starts per fifteen minutes per IP
 * and thirty passkey login options in the same window. A login screen that
 * re-probed on every render would exhaust either before a user finished typing
 * a password.
 *
 * ## Why promises are cached rather than results
 *
 * Two components mounting in the same tick is the ordinary case, not the edge
 * one: the login form and its passkey button both ask on first paint. Caching
 * the in-flight promise makes the second ask join the first request instead of
 * racing it, which is the difference between one probe and two.
 *
 * ## Why `unknown` is not cached
 *
 * A probe that failed on a flaky network learned nothing. Caching that answer
 * would hide the affordance for the life of the page over one dropped request,
 * so an `unknown` result is evicted as it resolves and the next ask probes
 * again. `unavailable` is a deployment fact and does not change under the
 * page, so it is kept.
 */

/**
 * What one probe concluded.
 *
 * `unknown` is deliberately not `unavailable`: it is what a network failure or
 * a CORS surprise leaves behind, and a caller renders nothing rather than
 * telling a user a capability is off when the probe simply could not be made.
 */

 * Keyed by the full probed URL, which folds the API origin into the key: two
 * bundles pointed at different backends cannot share an answer.
