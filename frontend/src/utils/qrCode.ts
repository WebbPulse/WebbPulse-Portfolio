/**
 * A QR encoder, written here rather than pulled in as a dependency.
 *
 * The only thing this application ever encodes is one `otpauth://totp/...`
 * provisioning URI, shown once during TOTP enrolment. A QR library is a large
 * surface and a supply chain entry for a single screen, and the identity
 * package deliberately ships no generator of its own: `TotpEnrolmentStarted`
 * documents that rendering the URI is the product's job. So the subset of
 * ISO/IEC 18004 that a provisioning URI needs lives here.
 *
 * ## What is implemented, and what is left out
 *
 * Byte mode only, error correction level M, versions 1 to 10. That is the
 * smallest thing that encodes the input this application has:
 *
 * - A provisioning URI is ASCII, so byte mode covers it and the alphanumeric
 *   and kanji modes would never be selected. Mode selection would be dead code.
 * - Level M is the level most authenticator documentation assumes and holds 213
 *   bytes at version 10, which is far beyond any issuer and label pair this
 *   service produces. A URI longer than that throws rather than silently
 *   producing an unreadable symbol, and {@link encodeQrCode} says so.
 * - Versions above 10 are not built, for capacity that a provisioning URI
 *   cannot reach. Versions 7 and up are, and those carry the 18 bit version
 *   information block that {@link placeVersionInformation} writes; a symbol
 *   that omits it is not merely missing a hint, because the modules it
 *   occupies would otherwise be filled with data and shift the entire stream.
 *
 * ## Why the mask is chosen rather than fixed
 *
 * All eight masks are evaluated with the four penalty rules from the standard
 * and the lowest scoring one wins. Fixing a mask is tempting and produces a
 * symbol that scans in a test, but the penalty rules exist because some data
 * and mask combinations put long runs or 1:1:3:1:1 sequences into the symbol,
 * which is what makes a reader mistake data for a finder pattern. The input
 * here varies with the account label, so the combination is not known ahead of
 * time and cannot be checked once by hand.
